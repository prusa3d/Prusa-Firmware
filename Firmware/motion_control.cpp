    /* Vector rotation by transformation matrix: r is the original vector, r_T is the rotated vector,
       and phi is the angle of rotation. Based on the solution approach by Jens Geisler.
           r_T = [cos(phi) -sin(phi);
                  sin(phi)  cos(phi] * r ;

       For arc generation, the center of the circle is the axis of rotation and the radius vector is
       defined from the circle center to the initial position. Each line segment is formed by successive
       vector rotations. This requires only two cos() and sin() computations to form the rotation
       matrix for the duration of the entire arc. Error may accumulate from numerical round-off, since
       all double numbers are single precision on the Arduino. (True double precision will not have
       round off issues for CNC applications.) Single precision error can accumulate to be greater than
       tool precision in some cases. Therefore, arc path correction is implemented.

       The small angle approximation was removed because of excessive errors for small circles (perhaps unique to
       3d printing applications, causing significant path deviation and extrusion issues).
       Now there will be no corrections applied, but an accurate initial sin and cos will be calculated.
       This seems to work with a very high degree of accuracy and results in much simpler code.

       Finding a faster way to approximate sin, knowing that there can be substantial deviations from the true
       arc when using the previous approximation, would be beneficial.
